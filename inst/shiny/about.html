<!-- CoGA performs statistical tests to identify differentially regulated genes. -->

<p>CoGA performs statistical tests to identify differentially regulated gene
sets from
gene expression data. Furthermore, it provides tools to 
explore each gene set, such as network visualization, 
ranking of genes according to their "importance" in the 
network, and single gene differential expression analysis.
