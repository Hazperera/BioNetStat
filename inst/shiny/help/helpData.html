<p>
    To run a BioNetStat analysis, you must upload
    on the left sidebar files containing variable values data,
    and a collection of variables sets. Detailed
    information about the data formats are described below.
</p>

<h5> Variables values data (To ensure that the file could be read, upload the following files formats. *.csv or *.txt)</h5>

<p>
    The variables values data is a semicolon delimited file that contains
    the values assumed by the variables of all the samples. 
    The first line has the following format:
</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;color:gray">
    &nbsp; Factor name;[variable 1 name];[variable 2 name]; ...
</p>

<p>
    Its is also allowed to insert the variables values data 
    in a tab delimited file following the similar format of semicolon delimited file:
</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;color:gray">
    &nbsp; Factor name[tab][variable 1 name][tab][variable 2 name][tab] ...
</p>

<p> 
    Each line contains the values for each sample that has to be informed 
    in one of the collums of this line.
</p>

<p>
    You can create the variables values input file with a spreadsheet software, 
    and then save it as a csv or tab delimited text file. 
    The final file must have the *.csv or *.txt extension.
</p>

    The figure below illustrates an expression input file:

<h5>Variable set database (*.gmt)</h5>

<p>
    The variable set database file describes the groups of variables that will be analyzed. The columns are tab delimited. Each row corresponds to a variable set. The first column describes the variable set name, the second one could contains a variable set description, and the following columns contain the variables that belong to the set. The file must have the *.gmt extension and is illustrated by the figure below:

    Several gmt format gene set collections are freely available at the 
    Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) 
    (<a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp</a>) (Subramanian <i>et al.</i>, 2005).
